# hello-world
getting acquainted (again)
I used to develop (Assembler, Fortran IV, Fortran-77, Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C, C#) but that was a long time ago. Now interested into (enterprise) blockchain concepts in general. Want to learn a bit of the underlying basics again so I better understand the work developers need to do.
